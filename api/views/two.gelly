// title: Seaside census
// backstory: It can be tough to get an exact count of jellyfish, they travel in single file to hide their numbers. Maybe there's another way you can count all the jellies?
// prompt: Get a total count of the number of jellyfish records.

// solution:
view { 
    count(jellyfishes) 
}

// hint: Gelly also has built-in data aggregation functions.
