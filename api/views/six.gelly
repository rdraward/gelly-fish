// title: Long jellies only
// backstory: Taking a picture of only 3 jellies worked, but it turned out you just got the first 3 jellyfish in line. They're all different lengths and don't fit in the frame! Try taking a picture of the 3 longest jellyfish instead.
// prompt: 

// solution:
view {
  jellyfishes {
    name
    length
    [order by length desc limit 3]
  }
}
