// backstory: Now let's get a snap of just the oldies (they don't have much longer and should be memorialized in photos)!
// prompt: Query for the name and age of all jellyfish older than 3.

  jellyfishes {
    name
    age
    [where age > 3]
  }
}

// hint: You can also apply where conditions to selections, not just aggregations.
